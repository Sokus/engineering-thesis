# Engineering Thesis
First "big" project I've worked on, also the first team coding experience. Almost everything was created from scratch - network layer, communication protocol, bit-level serialization, UI layouting and interaction, server code and most of the client application. Client app relies on [Raylib](https://www.raylib.com/index.html) library for creating the window, initializing OpenGL context and handling user input.
